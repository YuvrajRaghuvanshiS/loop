We poll every store roughly every hour and have data about whether the store was active or not in a CSV 
A) store_id, timestamp_utc, status

We have the business hours of all the stores
B) store_id, dayOfWeek(0=Monday, 6=Sunday), start_time_local, end_time_local

Timezone for the stores
C) store_id, timezone_str


Steps:
For each store in A:
    Find its timezone.
    Covert local open/close time into UTC.
    Check the status if it was open/close when it was supposed to be open.
